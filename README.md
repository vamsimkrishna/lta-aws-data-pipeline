# 🚀 LTA AWS Data Pipeline 

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **cloud-based data engineering pipeline** built using **Python, AWS S3, and Athena**.

The pipeline ingests real-time transport data from Singapore’s LTA API, stores it in a cloud data lake, transforms it into structured format, and enables SQL-based analytics using Athena.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Transport data from APIs is often unstructured and not stored for historical analysis. This project solves that by:

- Ingesting real-time API data
- Storing raw data in a scalable cloud storage (S3)
- Transforming nested JSON into structured tabular data
- Enabling analytics using SQL without managing infrastructure

## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

1. Fetch bus arrival data from LTA API
2. Store raw JSON data locally and upload to S3
3. Transform nested JSON into structured tabular format
4. Upload processed data to S3
5. Query data using Athena

---

## 📊 Sample Queries

- Count total records
- Service frequency analysis
- Load distribution
- Data completeness checks
